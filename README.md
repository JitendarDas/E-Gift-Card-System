# E-Gift-Card-System
An eGift Card System project is a digital solution that enables users to purchase, send, and redeem gift cards electronically. 
The system typically includes a web or mobile interface where users can choose from various gift card designs, specify an amount, and send the card via email or SMS. 
The recipient receives a code that can be redeemed online or in stores. The system also manages the balance, tracks usage, and ensures secure transactions. 
It's often integrated with payment gateways and may include features like scheduling delivery, personal messages, and notifications.

An eGift Card System project uses Python, HTML, CSS, SQL, and Flask to create a digital platform for buying, sending, and redeeming gift cards.

Python: Handles backend logic, transactions, and code generation.
HTML: Structures the web pages.
CSS: Styles the interface for a user-friendly experience.
SQL: Manages the database, storing user info, card details, and transaction history.
Flask: Acts as the web framework, connecting frontend and backend, and managing user sessions.
Together, these technologies create a seamless, secure, and attractive eGift Card system.

NOTE : THE PROJECT IS STILL IN PROGRESS
